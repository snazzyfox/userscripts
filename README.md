[![Userscript Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/Userscript-Install-informational?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/snazzyfox/userscripts/raw/main/twitch-mod-alt.user.js)

Hides mod buttons in twitch chat, only showing them when the Alt button is held down. Helps prevent accidentally clicking on mod buttons when trying to do other things in the chat window. *You must have twitch's "mod buttons" switch turned on for this to work.*
